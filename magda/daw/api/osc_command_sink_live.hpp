/**
 * @brief Applies the OSC fixed namespace to the running DAW (#1757).
 *
 * The `_live` half of the OSC stack, in the same sense as the rest of this
 * directory: the routing above it is pure and testable, and this is where it
 * meets real tracks. Called on the message thread, once per address per drain.
 *
 * ## Two paths, deliberately
 *
 * Levels — track and master volume and pan, sends — go through
 * `ControllerParamWriter`, the same writer the MIDI control surfaces use. That
 * is not reuse for its own sake: the writer maps a normalized value through the
 * parameter's real range, so an OSC fader, a MIDI fader and an automation curve
 * at the same position produce the same gain, and its host-write path keeps
 * working when an LFO or macro is already driving the target.
 *
 * Everything else — transport, tempo, mute, solo, focused macros — goes through
 * `MagdaApi`, because these are states rather than parameter values and the
 * facade already routes them the way the on-screen controls do. Play in
 * particular dispatches through the same playhead-aware path as the Play
 * button, so a tablet and the transport bar cannot disagree about what Play
 * means.
 *
 * ## Addressing
 *
 * `/magda/track/{n}` is the nth strip visible in the mixer, and
 * `/magda/track/{n}/send/{m}` its mth send, both 1-based. Positions rather than
 * IDs, because IDs are sparse and a template's eight strips are not: deleting a
 * track renumbers what follows it, which is exactly what a surface showing
 * eight faders expects. A position with no track behind it is ignored — a
 * sixteen-strip template pointed at an eight-track project drives eight faders
 * rather than failing.
